React
------
react is a frontend library of javascript
----------------------------------------------------------------
Angular                                               React
----------------------------------------------------------------

-framework                                             -library

-real Dom                                              -virtual Dom
  -it have phisycal dom strucutre.                        -it dosent have any physical structure it is a virual concept,it doesnt need more memory space,if we edit any one component that component only recompail so it is faster than angular
  so it need more memory
  if we edit any one component it will 
  recompail enteir file.so it is slower than react

-building blocks                                       -bulding blocks of react
html,css,ts                                              html,css,js


Advantages of React
------------------
-virual dom (faster,no need memory space for store dom)
-reusable components (effectively (we can change the behaviour of component and use it))
-concept of jsx(javascript Xml) - js and html done in a same page that is jsx

installation command
---------------------
global installation
-------------------
npm i -g create-react-app projectName



local installation
------------------
//node package exicute
npx create-react-app projectName


data sharing
------------
parent component to child component

variable--state(use insted of variables)


      props ---method()
      -----
      technic used to share data from parent component to child component 

      destructuring-method()
      -------------
      simillar to props 

Class based React is statefull,but fuction based react is stateless.
compared to class ,function based is simple but it is stateless
with the help of hooks it resolve , so further use fuction based


hooks
-----
hooks are many types

To create statefull ----useState---react library


js api
------
AjAX
----
1.xmlHttps
2.fetch
3.async await - we can directly strored in a variable (when we do asynchronous call)


hooks
=====
useEffect - hook used to all function at starting of components (instead of ngoninit)


Redirection In React
--------------------
react-router-dom ==library used to Redirection
1.BrowserRouter--root component selector
2.Router--for path setting
3.Routes--if we use more than one path

params
======
useparams--hooks used to access params


=========
| REDUX |
=========
 
  propsDrilling==when increase couping it will due propsDrilling
    data will stuck in any intermediate component when the component have any issue
    propsdrilling occur during coupling(may connection between parent and child)


To avoid propsdrilling need to reduce coupling and make all component intipendent

so react introduce a state management technology that is REDUX 

a js store file

redux 
react-redux
redux-thunk
